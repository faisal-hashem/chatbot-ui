- Create EC2 instance for Jenkins with t2.large and SSH keys
- Create IAM Role with EC2 Administrator Access and assign the role to the Jenkins server
- Run scripts on Jenkins server to install Jenkins and other dependencies
- See Scripts folder - jenkins.sh 
- Login Jenkins server on port 8080 (make sure the security group allows for inbound 8080 connections from your machine)
- Install plugins on Jenkins server
- Install Docker on Jenkins server with the following:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   #my case is ubuntu
    newgrp docker
    sudo chmod 777 /var/run/docker.sock

- Spin up Docker container with sonarqube on port 9000
    docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:lts-community

- Validate you are able to login to Sonarqube with admin/admin 
- Install Trivy, Kubectl and Terraform on Jenkins server
- See Scripts folder - script.sh (make sure you run chmod 777 script.sh)

- Install all the plugins on Jenkins Server:
    Blue ocean, Terraform, Eclipse Temurin Installer, SonarQube Scanner, 
    NodeJs Plugin, Docker, Docker commons, Docker pipeline, Docker API, Docker Build step, Owasp Dependency Check, Kubernetes
    Kubernetes CLI, Kubernetes Client API, Kubernetes Pipeline DevOps steps

- Configure Plugins through Tools for JDK and Node19
- Create Sonarqube Token and add credentials to Jenkins Server global creds as Sonar-token
- Since you are there in Credentials, you can also add the creds for Dockerhub as "docker" for id and description
- Configure Jenkins System settings to include URL for Sonarqube (http://localhost:9000) and the Sonar-token

- Set up Sonarqube webhook to connect with Jenkins URL: http://jenkins-public-ip:8080>/sonarqube-webhook/
- Configure Jenkins plugin tools for Dependency Checks and Docker, and Terraform 

- Update the backend.tf and main.tf file in the legacy branch to your region and your S3 bucket

- Create Jenkins Pipeline with parameters for apply/destroy for EKS-Terraform to deploy all AWS resources for EKS cluster
- See eks-terraform-jenkins in Scripts folder
- Run the pipeline and validate EKS cluster creation

- Add Sonarqube Project for chatbot that points to legacy branch
- Create new chatbot pipeline with 'Discard old builds' selections checked off with Days to keep builds set to 1 and Max # of builds to keep 4.

- What was failing? 
    - Sonar Scanner, ran the following:
        Updated Sonarqube Servers settings URL to localhost instead of Public IP.
        
    - Docker connection, ran the following on jenkins:
        sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
        sudo systemctl restart jenkins
        sudo systemctl restart docker
        sudo -u jenkins docker info

    - Was not able to access PublicIP:3000, had to add inbound rule.
